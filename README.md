# PWL Starter Template

This project serves as a starter template for the Puglia Women Lead AI hackathon. It's designed to get you up and running with a basic server setup using Express.

## Features

- **Express Server**: Utilizes Express for the backend server, providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Nodemon**: Integrated with Nodemon for automatic server restarts upon file changes, enhancing the development experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/marcopesani/pwl-starter-template.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd pwl-starter-template`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

This will start the server with Nodemon, which will watch for any file changes in the `server` and `public` directories and restart the server automatically.

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the server in production mode.
- `npm run dev`: Runs the server in development mode with Nodemon.
